      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        On my site, people will come and want to read about the success stories of people who have transformed their homes. They will want to see the inspiration for a clean home and how it can be done without purchasing anything. Visitors will also want a step-by-step beginner's guide to simplifying their house. They would also want a blog of ideas for how to keep spaces clean once they have already been simplified. They will also want to see other resources that they can turn to so they can learn different tactics for staying organized. (Some ideas for this could include referencing The Minimal Mom and Clutterbugâ€™s quiz about their organizing type.) <br>

        People will choose to come to my site because it is laid out simply and without judgment. There will be easy-to-follow step-by-step printables that show the foundational principles of decluttering. Along with that, there will be success stories from people who were originally messy people but were able to simplify their life to a point where the house is easy to keep clean and their family can live together in a peaceful environment.

      <h3>Blog</h3>
      <p>
        The main purpose of my site will be to educate people on minimalism. It can explain the core principles of minimalism, such as decluttering, reducing material possessions, and focusing on what truly matters. It can offer practical tips, techniques, and strategies to adopt a minimalist lifestyle. This information can empower individuals to make informed choices and take steps toward simplifying their lives.

        The first couple of blog posts will give guidance on various aspects of life, such as decluttering specific areas like closets, kitchens, or digital spaces. It can offer step-by-step guides, checklists, and resources to help individuals navigate the process of simplifying their physical and digital environments. This guidance can assist people in making practical changes that align with minimalist principles.

      <h3>Community</h3>
      <p>
        There could also be a community page. This is a platform where people can share their experiences and how minimalism has improved their lives. This page could link to discussion boards and other places on social media where people can find support through others experiencing the same things.
